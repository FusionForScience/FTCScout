# FTCScout
Scouting program for FTC competitions

#### Current Features
- Keeps track of the following:
  - Team Number
  - Team Name
  - Team Place (Competition Ranking)
  - Team TeleOp Abilities
  - Team Autonomous Abilities
  - Team Autonomous Paths
- Autonomous Paths can be drawn and displayed
- Autonomous Paths can be compared between different teams
- Additional teams can be added, removed, or edited (with the exception of team number)
- Data is stored in a file. This means that:
  - Data is safe between application launches
  - Data can be modified without the GUI (I strongly recommend against this)

#### Planned Features
- Custom data file locations
- More than one data file
- Search function

#### Things that I might look into in the future
- Networking

Built with Qt Creator 4.1.0 (Community).
As such, this project is open source.

I'll add compile instructions later because honestly I don't know them.
